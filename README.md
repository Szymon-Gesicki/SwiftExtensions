# SwiftExtension

## About
SGSwiftExtension was created for private use to avoid rewriting it in every project. It contains the most common functions used by me.

### Includes 
- remove duplicates from an array
- safe subscription to array like array[safe: 2], which returns null if no such index exists
- calculating the average of a collection
- formatting of float and double
- uppercase letter at the beginning of a string
- UIColor from rgb, hex (string and int)
- change color of UIImageView
- progress indicator in the middle of the UITableView
- simple animations on UIView like (fadeIn, fadeOut, springIn, springOut)

## Installation
- pod `SGSwiftExtensions`
